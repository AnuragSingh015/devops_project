# devops_project
We set up a CI/CD pipeline for a blog website using the following steps:

Step 1:- Project Management with Jira:
We began by using Jira as a project management tool to define the scope, manage tasks, and plan milestones for our blog website project.

Step 2:-Version Control with Git and GitHub:
we established a Git repository on GitHub to store our project's source code, allowing for version control and collaboration.
We are actively using Git to commit code changes, create branches, and merge code as needed.

Step 3:-Build Automation with Gradle:
Gradle was integrated as the build tool for our project, and we created build scripts to compile and package our website's source code.

Step 4:-Continuous Integration with Jenkins:
Jenkins was set up to handle continuous integration. It automatically builds and tests our code whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository on GitHub.

Step 5:-Deployment on AWS (Amplify):
We chose AWS Amplify as the deployment platform, where we host our website. Amplify provides a fully managed environment for deploying web applications.
